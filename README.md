# Mapsy

A beautiful visualisation tool for a quick geographical overview of artworks on Artsy. 


# Description

```
Based on the work of @mbostock .

Using the d3js library with topological data to plot it.

Afterwords the intention is of using JSON data extracted from the Artsy API.

Pumping the data into that svg and create data points that show Artworks from all over the world on a mouseover.

Hosting with hacking Heroku's system a bit to host static files. (Put a index.php file in your app directory and then set the php flag off with an .htaccess file with the content 'php_flag engine off')
